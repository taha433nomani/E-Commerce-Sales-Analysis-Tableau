## E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard built to analyze sales performance, customer insights, payment behavior, product performance, and regional revenue trends in an e-commerce business.

## Purpose
The E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive Tableau report designed to evaluate overall sales performance, customer demographics, product revenue contribution, and state-wise sales distribution.
This dashboard helps business stakeholders understand purchasing patterns, optimize product strategy, and support data-driven decision-making.

## Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• Microsoft Excel – Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and formatting before analysis.

• Tableau Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for dashboard development.

• Calculated Fields in Tableau – Used for KPIs, revenue metrics, and percentage analysis.

• Data Aggregation & Filtering – Used for category-based and demographic-based insights.

• File Format – .twb / .twbx for development and .png for dashboard previews.

## Data Source
Source: E-commerce transactional sales dataset.
The dataset includes:

Order Date

Customer Age

Gender

State

Product Category

Payment Method

Quantity Ordered

Discount Percentage

Revenue / Total Sales
The dataset was cleaned and structured in Excel before importing into Tableau for visualization and analysis.
